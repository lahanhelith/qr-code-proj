## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 

### What I learned

While working through this project I learned about how you can center a div horizontally and vertically on the page. Here's how to I did it:

```css
position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left:50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```
What the code does is set the position property of the div to absolute and then use the "top" and "left" properties to move the div and then using the translate function on the transform property to center the div.


### Continued development

During this time I realised I need to work on moving elements around in css.
